# Codebase Review (Updated)

This document provides a high-level overview and review of the TenorWisp Flutter application codebase, reflecting the current state of development.

## 1. Core App Concept

TenorWisp is a mobile messaging application built with Flutter and Firebase. The core concept has been refined to focus on private, one-on-one direct messaging. The application now supports real-time text, image, and video communication between users who have added each other as friends.

## 2. Project Structure & Technology

The project follows a standard Flutter layout. The core application logic resides in the `lib/` directory. The initial 3-tab navigation was refactored into a 2-tab system (`MainAppShell`) focusing on "Chats" and "Account".

- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage)
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`
  - `image_picker`: For selecting images and videos from the user's device.
  - `video_player` & `chewie`: For in-app video playback.

- **Key Files:**
  - **`lib/main.dart`**: The application's entry point, handling Firebase initialization and routing via the `AuthWrapper`.
  - **`lib/app_theme.dart`**: Centralized theme file for a consistent UI.
  - **`lib/main_app_shell.dart`**: The main UI shell after login, containing the `BottomNavigationBar` for "Chats" and "Account" screens.
  - **`lib/users_list_screen.dart`**: The "Chats" tab, which now displays the current user's list of friends. Tapping a friend initiates a chat.
  - **`lib/friends_screen.dart` & `lib/add_friend_screen.dart`**: Screens that manage the friend system, allowing users to view their friends, accept/decline requests, and search for new users to add.
  - **`lib/chat_screen.dart`**: The core messaging UI where users exchange real-time messages.
  - **`lib/chat_bubble.dart`**: A custom widget for displaying individual chat messages, with logic to handle text, images, and video playback.
  - **`firestore.rules` & `storage.rules`**: These files have been iteratively developed to provide secure access for the implemented chat and friend features.

## 3. Key Features Implemented

The application has evolved from a basic shell to a functional messaging prototype.

- **Friends Management System:** A complete friend system has been implemented.
    - **Data Model:** User documents in Firestore contain `friends`, `friendRequestsSent`, and `friendRequestsReceived` arrays to manage relationships.
    - **Functionality:** Users can search for other users by email, send friend requests, and accept or decline incoming requests.

- **Real-Time Direct Messaging:**
    - **Text & Media:** The `ChatScreen` supports real-time text messaging and the sending of images and videos.
    - **Backend:** A `chats` collection in Firestore stores message history. Each chat is a document containing a `messages` subcollection. Cloud Storage is used to store image and video files in a `chat_media/` directory, with messages in Firestore containing the corresponding storage URL.
    - **UI:** A `StreamBuilder` listens for new messages in real-time. The `ChatBubble` widget dynamically displays content, embedding a `Chewie` video player for videos.

- **Security Rules:** The `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` have been carefully crafted to enforce security. They prevent unauthorized data access while enabling the necessary functionality for searching users, managing friendships, and exchanging media only between authorized users.

## 4. Overall Assessment

### Strengths
*   **Functional Core:** The project has successfully implemented the most critical features of a messaging app: a friend system and real-time, media-rich chat.
*   **Secure Backend:** Significant effort has been invested in writing robust Firebase security rules, which is crucial for a social application.
*   **Good Architecture:** The component-based structure (e.g., `ChatBubble`, `MainAppShell`) and use of `StreamBuilder` for real-time data are effective and scalable.

### Areas for Improvement & Next Steps
*   **UX Enhancements:** The user experience can be greatly improved by adding features like read receipts, typing indicators, and user online/offline status.
*   **Account Management:** The `AccountScreen` is currently a placeholder. It should be built out to allow users to update their profile picture, change their password, and log out.
*   **Robustness:** Further work is needed on error handling (e.g., failed media uploads, network issues) and UI polish to create a more production-ready application.

## 5. Conclusion

The TenorWisp codebase has progressed significantly from a simple boilerplate to a functional prototype of a direct messaging application. The architecture is sound, and the implemented features are robust and secure. The project is in an excellent position to refine the user experience and add more features.
