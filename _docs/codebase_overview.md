# Codebase Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the TenorWisp Flutter application codebase.

### Overall Assessment

**Strengths:**
*   **Solid Foundation:** The project structure is logical and scalable. The separation of concerns, like having a dedicated `AuthWrapper` for authentication logic and a centralized `app_theme.dart` for styling, is excellent.
*   **Modern Practices:** The code follows current Flutter best practices. Asynchronous operations are handled gracefully with loading indicators and error messages. Using `StreamBuilder` for auth state is efficient, and the global theme is implemented correctly.
*   **Clear and Readable:** The code is clean, well-organized, and commented where it matters, making it easy to understand and build upon.

**Areas for Improvement & Next Steps:**
*   **User Registration:** Currently, there's only a login screen. A sign-up flow is a necessary next step for new users.
*   **Core Feature Implementation:** The foundational pieces are in place to start building the app's main features, such as integrating Cloud Firestore for user data and messages, Cloud Storage for media, and developing the chat UI itself.

### Conclusion

The codebase is in an excellent state. It's a well-architected starting point that demonstrates a strong grasp of Flutter and Firebase fundamentals. You've set up a solid foundation to begin implementing the core features of the TenorWisp application.
