## User Stories for "The Contributor" (Sarah)

These stories focus on the core user's desire for safe, meaningful, and low-pressure engagement.

### 1. Submitting a Topic Idea

**As a** Contributor, **I want to** privately and anonymously submit a topic I'm interested in, **so that** I can see if others share my interest without the fear of my idea being immediately judged or ignored.

### 2. Discovering New Threads

**As a** Contributor, **I want to** see a small number of new, high-quality discussion topics each day, **so that** I can easily digest what the community is thinking about without feeling overwhelmed by an endless feed.

### 3. Understanding Collective Opinion *(Future Feature)*

**As a** Contributor, **I want to** read AI-generated summaries of different viewpoints on a topic, **so that** I can quickly understand the main arguments and decide where my own opinion fits in.

### 4. Expressing an Opinion Privately *(Future Feature)*

**As a** Contributor, **I want to** submit my response to a thread privately, **so that** I can express my honest thoughts without worrying about direct replies, downvotes, or starting an argument.

## User Stories for "The Curator" (The Admin)

These stories focus on your role in managing the content, ensuring quality, and demonstrating the app's functionality.

### 1. Initiating Content Generation *(Your Manual Trigger)*

**As a** Curator, **I want to** manually trigger the creation of new threads from user submissions with a single action, **so that** I can control the content cycle for development, testing, and live demonstrations.

### 2. Reviewing Topic Clusters

**As a** Curator, **I want to** see the clusters of topic submissions before the final threads are generated, **so that** I can ensure the chosen topics are interesting, appropriate, and accurately reflect the users' collective interest. *(This is a great story for a "human-in-the-loop" system to maintain quality).*

### 3. Seeding Initial Content *(For the "Cold Start" Problem)*

**As a** Curator, **I want to** be able to submit topic ideas myself that are fed into the generation system, **so that** I can ensure there is always fresh content for users, especially when the user base is small.

### 4. Automating Content Generation *(Future Feature)*

**As a** Curator, **I want to** schedule the thread generation process to run automatically at a set time each day, **so that** I don't have to manually manage the content cycle once the platform is established.
