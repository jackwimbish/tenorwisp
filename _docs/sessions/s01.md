# Session 1: Codebase Review, Fonts, Registration, and Firebase Debugging

This document summarizes the progress made during our first development session.

### 1. Initial Codebase Analysis
- We began with a thorough review of the existing codebase, including `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/main.dart`, `lib/login_screen.dart`, and the overall project structure.
- The initial assessment was very positive. The project has a solid foundation, using a `StreamBuilder` for authentication state management, a centralized theme in `app_theme.dart`, and clean, readable code.
- Key areas for immediate improvement were identified:
    1.  A placeholder font ('YourCustomFont') was referenced but not included in the project.
    2.  A user registration flow was missing.
- The full analysis was saved to `_docs/codebase_overview.md`.

### 2. Implementing a Custom Font
- We addressed the font issue by selecting the "Nunito" font.
- An `assets/fonts/` directory was created, and the user added the necessary font files.
- I updated `pubspec.yaml` to declare the new font family and its assets.
- I modified `lib/app_theme.dart` to replace the placeholder font with "Nunito", applying the font globally.

### 3. Building the User Registration Flow
- A plan was established to create a new registration screen consistent with the existing login screen's architecture.
- I created `lib/registration_screen.dart` and added a navigation link from the login screen.
- **Username on Signup:** The registration form was updated to include a username field, making it a required part of the onboarding process.
- **Navigation Fix:** The registration flow was improved to automatically navigate users to the home screen upon successful signup.

### 4. Account Management and Profile Pictures
- **Account Screen:** A new `lib/account_screen.dart` was created to allow users to manage their profile. Navigation to this screen was added to the `HomeScreen`.
- **Unique Usernames:** Implemented a system for unique usernames. This involved:
    - Adding a `usernames` collection to Firestore to enforce uniqueness.
    - Updating `firestore.rules` with the necessary security logic.
    - Building the logic in the account screen to let users set or change their username, using a batched write for data integrity.
- **Profile Pictures:**
    - Integrated `image_picker` to allow users to upload a profile picture from their gallery.
    - Implemented `firebase_storage` to store the uploaded images.
    - Updated `storage.rules` to secure the `profile_pictures` directory.
- **Default Avatars:**
    - Integrated the **DiceBear** API to automatically generate and assign a unique, random SVG avatar to every new user upon registration.
    - Added the `flutter_svg` package to handle rendering these avatars.
    - Implemented logic in the account screen to correctly display both SVG avatars and user-uploaded raster images (JPG/PNG).

### 5. Debugging and Troubleshooting
- **Firebase `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` Error:**
    - Diagnosed this native Android error as a Firebase configuration issue.
    - We first added the **SHA-1 debug fingerprint** to the Firebase project, which is a required step for Android authentication.
    - We then diagnosed and fixed several permissions issues in `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` that were causing compilation errors or blocking requests. This included making the `usernames` collection publicly readable to check for availability during registration.
- **Firestore `NOT_FOUND` Error:**
    - Resolved a crash that occurred when an existing user (created before Firestore was implemented) tried to update their profile. The fix involved changing database `update` operations to `set` with a `merge: true` option for greater resilience.
- **SVG Rendering Bug:**
    - Fixed an issue where default profile pictures appeared blank because the standard `Image` widget cannot render SVGs. This was resolved by adding the `flutter_svg` package and implementing conditional logic to use the correct rendering widget.
- **Console Warnings:**
    - Clarified that the `ProviderInstaller` warnings seen on app startup are benign and can be safely ignored, as they relate to optional security provider updates on emulators.
