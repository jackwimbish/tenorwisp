# Session 1: Codebase Review, Fonts, Registration, and Firebase Debugging

This document summarizes the progress made during our first development session.

### 1. Initial Codebase Analysis
- We began with a thorough review of the existing codebase, including `pubspec.yaml`, `lib/main.dart`, `lib/login_screen.dart`, and the overall project structure.
- The initial assessment was very positive. The project has a solid foundation, using a `StreamBuilder` for authentication state management, a centralized theme in `app_theme.dart`, and clean, readable code.
- Key areas for immediate improvement were identified:
    1.  A placeholder font ('YourCustomFont') was referenced but not included in the project.
    2.  A user registration flow was missing.
- The full analysis was saved to `_docs/codebase_overview.md`.

### 2. Implementing a Custom Font
- We addressed the font issue by selecting the "Nunito" font.
- An `assets/fonts/` directory was created.
- The user downloaded and added the necessary font files (`.ttf`).
- I updated `pubspec.yaml` to declare the new font family and its assets.
- I modified `lib/app_theme.dart` to replace the placeholder font with "Nunito", applying the font globally.

### 3. Building the User Registration Flow
- A plan was established to create a new registration screen consistent with the existing login screen's architecture.
- I created `lib/registration_screen.dart`, which included a `StatefulWidget` with form fields for email, password, and password confirmation.
- The registration logic included form validation, calling `FirebaseAuth.instance.createUserWithEmailAndPassword()`, and robust error handling for common scenarios like a weak password or an email already in use.
- A navigation link was added to `lib/login_screen.dart` to allow users to access the new registration page.

### 4. Debugging and Troubleshooting
- **Email Validation Bug:** The user discovered a bug preventing registration due to a faulty regular expression for email validation. I located the incorrect regex in `lib/registration_screen.dart` and corrected it.
- **Firebase `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND` Error:**
    - Upon trying to register again, a native Android error (`An internal error has occurred. [ CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND ]`) was reported.
    - We diagnosed this as a Firebase configuration issue, likely a missing SHA-1 debug fingerprint in the Firebase project settings.
    - We attempted to generate the key using `./gradlew signingReport`, but the command failed because a Java runtime was not found.
    - I guided the user to install `openjdk` using Homebrew.
    - After successfully finding the Java path, we ran the command again and successfully generated the SHA-1 key.
    - The error persisted after the user added the key to Firebase. Our current step is to verify other common causes: ensuring the package name in `build.gradle.kts` matches the one in the Firebase console and confirming that the "Email/Password" sign-in provider is enabled in Firebase Authentication settings.
