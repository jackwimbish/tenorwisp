# Session 04: AI Backend Foundation and Deployment

## Goals
- Clarify the architectural direction of the project.
- Implement Phase 1 of the AI platform: a secure, triggerable backend foundation.
- Deploy and verify the new backend service.
- Update project documentation to reflect the new architecture.

## Outcomes
This session marked a major architectural pivot for the TenorWisp project. We successfully established a hybrid model where the existing Firebase-based messaging features will coexist with a new Python-based AI backend for topic generation.

### 1. Architectural Strategy
- We resolved a conflict in the project documentation, confirming that the new AI backend (Python/FastAPI) will be developed alongside the existing messaging backend (Firebase/Cloud Functions).
- The Python backend will be responsible for asynchronous, heavy-lifting AI tasks, starting with processing user submissions to generate discussion topics.
- Firebase will continue to serve as the primary database and real-time backend for the user-facing application.

### 2. Backend Implementation (Phase 1)
- Following the plan in `implementation-phase-1.md`, we created the complete file structure for the new Python service in the `/backend` directory.
- A minimalist FastAPI server (`main.py`) was created, featuring a single, secure endpoint (`/api/admin/start_generation_round`) protected by API key authentication.
- A corresponding CLI script (`trigger_generation.py`) was created at the project root to securely call this endpoint.
- All necessary configuration files (`requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, `.gitignore`, `.env`) were created and correctly configured.

### 3. Local and Remote Verification
- We successfully installed all Python dependencies and ran the FastAPI server on localhost.
- We tested the end-to-end communication loop locally, debugging and resolving a `401 Unauthorized` error by ensuring the `.env` file was correctly sourced by the server.
- After deployment to Railway, we ran a final verification test, confirming that the local `trigger_generation.py` script could successfully and securely communicate with the live production backend.

### 4. Documentation
- The primary `_docs/codebase_review.md` document was completely overhauled to reflect the new hybrid architecture, the purpose of each backend service, and the successful completion of the foundational work for the AI platform.

## Conclusion
Phase 1 of the AI platform implementation is **complete**. We have a fully deployed, secure backend foundation. The project is now in an excellent position to proceed with implementing the core AI logic and the user-facing submission flow.
