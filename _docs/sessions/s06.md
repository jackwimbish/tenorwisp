# Session 06: Frontend Refactoring & Architectural Improvement

## 1. Overview

This session focused on a significant refactoring of the Flutter frontend codebase. The primary goal was to improve the architectural quality by decoupling UI from business logic, improving testability, and increasing code maintainability. We identified key areas for improvement and systematically implemented the changes.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

### 2.1. Code Review & Planning

-   **Analysis:** We began by conducting a thorough review of the `lib/` directory to identify complex and tightly-coupled components.
-   **Candidates Identified:** The `submission_screen.dart` and `chat_screen.dart` files were identified as the primary candidates for refactoring due to their mix of UI, state management, and direct service calls.
-   **Created Refactoring Plan:** A detailed plan was created and stored in `_docs/refactor_candidates.md`, outlining the "why" and "how" for each proposed change.

### 2.2. Implemented a Service-Oriented Architecture

-   **Introduced Service Layer:** We created dedicated service classes (`SubmissionService`) to encapsulate all business logic and external data source interactions (Firestore), removing this responsibility from the widgets.
-   **Implemented Dependency Injection:** To decouple the UI from the new service layer, we introduced the `get_it` package as a service locator. All services are now registered in a central `lib/service_locator.dart` file and provided to the UI, rather than being instantiated directly within widgets.
-   **Centralized Logic:** Complex logic flows, such as creating a user submission or picking and uploading media in the chat, were moved from the widget state classes into their respective services (`SubmissionService`, `ChatService`).

### 2.3. Decomposed Complex Widgets

-   **`SubmissionScreen` Refactor:** The widget was broken down into three smaller, more manageable components:
    -   `SubmissionScreen`: The main screen that decides which view to show.
    -   `SubmissionCreationForm`: A dedicated widget for the submission input form.
    -   `ActiveSubmissionView`: A widget to display the user's current submission.
-   **`ChatScreen` Refactor:** The chat UI was simplified by extracting the message list and input bar into their own builder methods (`_buildMessageList`, `_buildMessageInput`), cleaning up the main build method significantly.

### 2.4. Bug Fixes & Codebase Documentation

-   **Corrected Media Picker Logic:** Fixed a bug where the "Record Video" option in the chat was incorrectly defaulting to the "Take Photo" action.
-   **Updated Codebase Review:** The primary `_docs/codebase_review.md` was updated to reflect the new, more modular frontend architecture, documenting the adoption of the service layer and dependency injection as key strengths.

## 3. Outcome

The frontend codebase is now significantly more robust, maintainable, and testable. By establishing a clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic, we have created a more scalable and developer-friendly architecture that will be easier to build upon in future sessions.
