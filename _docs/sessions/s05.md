# Session 05: Implementing the User Submission Flow (Phase 2)

## Goal
The primary goal of this session was to implement Phase 2 of the development plan: building the complete user-facing submission loop for the AI-powered discussion feature.

## Key Accomplishments

1.  **Firestore Rules Merged & Deployed:**
    *   We analyzed the new security rules required for the submission feature and compared them against the existing rules for chat and friends.
    *   Identified and resolved conflicts by intelligently merging the two rulesets, ensuring no existing functionality was compromised.
    *   The final, unified `firestore.rules` file was successfully deployed to the Firebase project.

2.  **Submission UI Implemented (`SubmissionScreen`)**
    *   A new screen, `SubmissionScreen.dart`, was created to house the submission UI.
    *   A button was added to the `HomeScreen` to provide users with an entry point to the new feature.

3.  **Client-Side Batched Writes (Submit & Withdraw):**
    *   Implemented the core logic for submitting a new idea using a Firestore batched write, which atomically creates a `submissions` document and updates the corresponding `users` document with a `live_submission_id`.
    *   Implemented the "Withdraw" functionality, also using a batched write, to safely reverse the submission process by changing the submission's status to "withdrawn" and clearing the user's `live_submission_id`.

4.  **Dynamic Submission Status View:**
    *   The `SubmissionScreen` was enhanced with a `StreamBuilder` to listen for real-time changes to the user's document.
    *   The UI now dynamically displays either the submission form or the user's active submission, providing a seamless user experience.

5.  **Documentation Updated:**
    *   The `_docs/codebase_review.md` file was updated to reflect the completion of the user submission flow and to outline the next steps for Phase 3.

## Outcome
**Phase 2 of the development plan is now complete.** The application now fully supports the user-facing side of the core AI feature, from submitting an idea to viewing its status and withdrawing it. The project is now perfectly positioned to begin backend development for Phase 3.
