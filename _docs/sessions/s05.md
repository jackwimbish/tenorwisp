# Session 05: Feature Implementation, Debugging, and UI Refinement

## Goal
This session's goals evolved from initially implementing the user submission feature (Phase 2) to include significant debugging of the media pipeline and a major overhaul of the app's primary UI and navigation.

## Key Accomplishments

### Part 1: User Submission Flow (Phase 2)
1.  **Firestore Rules Merged & Deployed:** Successfully merged and deployed new security rules for the submission feature without compromising existing chat and friend functionality.
2.  **Submission UI Implemented (`SubmissionScreen`):** Created the UI for submitting, viewing, and withdrawing topic ideas.
3.  **Client-Side Logic:** Implemented robust, atomic batched writes for the submission and withdrawal processes.

### Part 2: Video Upload Debugging & Media Service
1.  **Investigation:** Diagnosed a critical bug preventing video uploads. The investigation traced the issue from a client-side permissions error to a backend Cloud Function crash.
2.  **Cloud Function Debugging:** Analyzed Cloud Function logs to identify and fix two separate issues: a `ReferenceError` from incorrect v1/v2 SDK mixing, and a logic error in parsing the message ID from the file path.
3.  **IAM Permissions Fix:** Identified and resolved a `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` permission error by assigning the `Service Account Token Creator` role to the correct compute service account, allowing the function to generate signed URLs.
4.  **Client-Side Compression:** Architected and implemented a reusable `MediaService` to handle client-side compression of both images and videos *before* upload, significantly improving performance and reducing costs.

### Part 3: UI/UX Placeholder and Refinement
1.  **Discussion UI Mockups:** Built a complete, interactive, multi-screen placeholder UI for the public discussion threads, including a thread list and a detailed view with mock text and image posts.
2.  **Navigation Cleanup:** Refactored the main application shell (`MainAppShell`) and `HomeScreen` to provide a clear, consistent navigation structure. Redundant titles and buttons were removed.
3.  **Home Screen Reorganization:** The `HomeScreen` layout was redesigned to use a standardized set of buttons, creating a more intuitive user experience.
4.  **Layout Bug Fixes:** Wrapped input composers in `SafeArea` widgets to prevent them from being obscured by native system UI on devices like Android.

5.  **Documentation Updated:** The `_docs/codebase_review.md` and this session file were updated to reflect all the progress made.

## Outcome
**Phase 2 of the development plan is complete, and the application is significantly more robust and user-friendly.** The video upload pipeline is now fully functional. A reusable media service has improved the app's architecture. The main navigation has been cleaned up, and a complete placeholder UI for the discussion feature is ready for demos and further development. The project is in an excellent position to proceed with backend AI logic implementation (Phase 3).
