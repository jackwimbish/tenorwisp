# Session 2: From Stories to Direct Messaging & Chat Implementation

This session documents the iterative development of the TenorWisp app, marked by a significant pivot from a "stories" feature to a direct messaging model, followed by the implementation of core chat functionalities.

### Phase 1: The "Stories" Pivot & Refinement
The initial feature request was to add image/video sharing, first conceptualized as a "stories" or "timeline" feature. To improve usability, a three-pillar navigation model was implemented using a `BottomNavigationBar` (`Home`, `Create`, `Account`).

This phase involved creating a `MainAppShell` widget and a `PreviewScreen` for the story creation flow. A common Android `GoogleApiManager` error was resolved by adding the correct SHA-1 fingerprint to the Firebase project settings.

### Phase 2: The "Direct Messaging" Pivot
A major change in direction occurred when the user decided to abandon the "stories" feature in favor of private, one-on-one direct messaging. This required a significant refactoring:
*   The `MainAppShell` was simplified to a two-tab layout ("Chats" and "Account").
*   `preview_screen.dart` was deleted.
*   `HomeScreen` was repurposed to become the main chat list.
*   `users_list_screen.dart` and `chat_screen.dart` were created.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Friends System
Before building the chat itself, a friends list feature was implemented.
*   **Data Model:** A request/accept model was designed using `friends`, `friendRequestsSent`, and `friendRequestsReceived` arrays within each user's Firestore document.
*   **UI:** A `FriendsScreen` with "My Friends" and "Requests" tabs was created, along with an `AddFriendScreen` for searching users.
*   **Implementation & Bug Fixes:**
    *   The user search was implemented, fixing a bug where results would disappear by switching from a `StreamBuilder` to a `FutureBuilder`.
    *   Multiple `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors from Firestore and Storage were resolved by iteratively refining `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules`.

### Phase 4: Building the Chat Functionality
With the friends system in place, the focus shifted to the chat itself.
*   The `UsersListScreen` was implemented to show friends and navigate to the `ChatScreen`.
*   The `ChatScreen` was built to handle sending and receiving real-time text messages.
*   Image and video messaging were added, requiring the `video_player` and `chewie` packages and a new `ChatBubble` widget.
*   **Bug Fixes:**
    *   A final `PERMISSION_DENIED` error from Cloud Storage was fixed by updating storage rules to allow writes to a `chat_media/{userId}` path.
    *   A bug causing videos to appear as empty bubbles was resolved by adding a unique `ValueKey` to each `ChatBubble` in the `ListView` and using a `FutureBuilder` to ensure the video player was initialized before rendering.
