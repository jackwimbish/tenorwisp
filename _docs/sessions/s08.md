# Session 08: Implementing the Public Discussion UI

**Goal:** Implement Phase 4 of the development plan: build a fully functional, live UI for displaying and interacting with the AI-generated discussion threads.

## 1. Initial Implementation: Closing the Loop

The session began by translating the detailed plan in `implementation-phase-4.md` into functional Flutter code.

-   **`PublicThreadsScreen` Implementation:** The placeholder screen was replaced with a live `StreamBuilder` that listens to the `public_threads` collection in Firestore. This screen now displays a real-time list of all available discussion topics.
-   **`ThreadDetailScreen` Implementation:** The detail screen was significantly enhanced:
    -   It was updated to accept a `threadId` to fetch the correct posts.
    -   The static mockup was replaced with a `StreamBuilder` listening to the `posts` sub-collection, displaying a live feed of the conversation.
    -   A complete comment submission feature was added, which correctly fetches the user's profile data (`username`, `photoURL`) from the `users` collection before posting.
-   **Polished UI with `PostBubble`:** A new, reusable `PostBubble` widget was created and integrated. This widget provides a polished chat-like appearance for posts and includes logic to visually distinguish between regular user comments and the special AI-generated "Thread Starter" posts.

## 2. Critical Bug Fixes & Refinements

With the initial implementation complete, we moved into a phase of testing and rapid-fire debugging to solve issues that only appear in a live data environment.

-   **Bug Fix: Missing AI-Generated Posts:**
    -   **Symptom:** The AI's initial post was visible in Firestore but did not appear on the `ThreadDetailScreen`.
    -   **Root Cause:** The backend script (`backend/main.py`) was not adding a `createdAt` timestamp to the initial post document. Firestore queries that `orderBy` a field will only return documents containing that field.
    -   **Solution:** The backend script was updated to include a `firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP` for both the main thread document and its initial post, ensuring they are correctly fetched by the frontend.

-   **Bug Fix: Permission Denied Errors:**
    -   **Symptom:** After fixing the timestamp issue, the app was still not displaying posts, and the debug console showed a `PERMISSION_DENIED` error.
    -   **Root Cause:** The `firestore.rules` file allowed reads on `public_threads/{threadId}` but had no corresponding rule for the nested `posts` sub-collection.
    -   **Solution:** The security rules were updated to explicitly grant authenticated users `read` and `create` access to the `/public_threads/{threadId}/posts/{postId}` path.

-   **Bug Fix: SVG User Avatars Not Displaying:**
    -   **Symptom:** User-commented posts showed a blank space or a placeholder icon instead of their profile picture.
    -   **Root Cause:** The user avatars were SVG files, which Flutter's standard `Image.network` widget cannot render.
    -   **Solution:** This was a multi-step fix:
        1.  The `flutter_svg` package was added to the project.
        2.  The `PostBubble` widget was updated to use `SvgPicture.network` for SVG URLs.
        3.  The initial URL check (`.endsWith('.svg')`) was found to be too simple. It was replaced with a more robust method that correctly parses the URL with `Uri.parse()` to handle query parameters and accurately identify SVG paths.

## 3. Documentation

To conclude the session, the `_docs/codebase_review.md` file was thoroughly updated to reflect all the new features, bug fixes, and overall progress, ensuring the project's high-level documentation is in sync with the current state of the codebase.

## Outcome

This was a highly productive session that took the AI discussion feature from a backend concept to a fully implemented, interactive, and polished user experience. The core feature loop of the application is now complete.
