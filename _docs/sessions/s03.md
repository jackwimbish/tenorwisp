# Session 03: Advanced Media Handling & Backend Implementation

This session marked a major leap in the application's architecture, moving from a purely client-side implementation to a robust, multi-layered system with a server-side component. We addressed significant performance issues with video messaging and implemented a production-ready media pipeline.

## 1. Initial Problem: Video Performance

We began by identifying two key performance problems with video messages in the `ChatScreen`:
1.  **Slow Loading:** Videos were fetched from Firebase Storage every time they appeared, resulting in slow initial playback.
2.  **Layout Jank:** Because the video's aspect ratio was unknown until it loaded, the `ChatBubble` would resize after the video was initialized, causing an ugly "jump" in the UI, especially when scrolling.

## 2. Solution Part 1: Client-Side Caching

To address the slow loading, we implemented a client-side caching mechanism:
-   **Dependency:** Added the `flutter_cache_manager` package.
-   **`VideoCacheService`:** Created a new service dedicated to abstracting the caching logic.
-   **`VideoPlayerWidget` Refactor:** Modified the video player to request files from the `VideoCacheService`. The service now handles downloading the video once and serving it from the local cache on all subsequent requests.

## 3. Solution Part 2: Server-Side Processing with Cloud Functions

To solve the layout jank and build a more robust system, we introduced a server-side backend using Cloud Functions for Firebase.

-   **Cloud Function Setup:**
    -   Initialized a new `functions/` directory in the project.
    -   Configured `package.json` with Node.js dependencies, including `firebase-admin`, `fluent-ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe-static`.
-   **Video Processing Logic:**
    -   Wrote a single Cloud Function in `index.js` that triggers whenever a video is uploaded to a temporary path in Cloud Storage.
    -   **The function automatically:**
        1.  Validates the video's file size against a defined maximum (100MB).
        2.  Generates a thumbnail image from the video's first frame.
        3.  Calculates the video's aspect ratio.
        4.  Moves the video and new thumbnail to a permanent storage location.
        5.  Updates the corresponding Firestore message document with the final URLs and calculated aspect ratio.
-   **Client-Side Refactor:**
    -   The `ChatScreen` was updated to upload videos to the temporary path, initiating the Cloud Function workflow.
    -   The `ChatBubble` was refactored to be a `StatefulWidget`. It now displays the thumbnail inside a correctly-sized `AspectRatio` widget first. The full `VideoPlayerWidget` is only loaded and played when the user taps the thumbnail.

## 4. Extensive Debugging and Hardening

The implementation of this advanced architecture involved a significant amount of debugging and hardening, which has made the overall system much more robust.

-   **Cloud Functions Deployment:** We systematically resolved a series of deployment errors, including:
    -   Upgrading the `firebase-functions` package to v2.
    -   Migrating the function from Gen1 to Gen2 by deleting the old stub.
    -   Waiting for Eventarc API and service agent permission propagation.
-   **Firestore Security Rules:** This was a major focus. We iteratively debugged and fixed numerous `PERMISSION_DENIED` errors. The key takeaways and final solutions were:
    -   Writing specific rules for `create`, `read`, and `update`.
    -   Correctly handling the "read-before-create" check for new chat documents.
    -   **Implementing the standard Firestore pattern for subcollection security:** We embedded a `participants` array in every message document and added a corresponding `where` clause to the client-side query. This was the final key to resolving the permission issues.
-   **Firestore Indexes:** We created the necessary composite index in `firestore.indexes.json` to support the new, secure query for fetching messages.
-   **Repository Management:** We created a `.gitignore` for the `functions` directory and provided the commands to untrack the large `build/` and `node_modules/` directories to keep the repository lean.

## 5. Outcome

TenorWisp now has a sophisticated, multi-layered architecture that is secure, scalable, and provides a high-performance user experience for media messaging. The codebase is significantly more mature and follows best practices for a production-level Firebase application.
